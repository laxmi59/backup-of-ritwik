					<a>Bad Credit is a term used in the financial industry to describe someone who is considered a "high risk" to loan providers and other finance organizations due to their poor repayment history of loans, mortgages and other financial aids or products. These types of borrowers are by and large perceived to be at very high risk of defaulting on their financial repayment duties as set out by finance lenders.</a>

					<a>A cash advance is also sometimes referred to as a payday loan or payday advance. A cash advance is a small amount of cash being lent to a prospective borrower for a short period of time.

					<a>The process where a person will have his/her credit history reviewed by a financial company or lender before credit is granted on a financial product or loan. If you’re applying for a secured loan for example, which obviously will carry more risk due to the loan amounts being higher, the loan provider will conduct a credit check while processing your loan application to determine if you would be able to repay the loan effectively. A credit check will usually also report a credit score to report a consumer’s credit worthiness.</a>

					<span><img src="images/aro.jpg" width="12" height="11" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Loans</span>
					<a>Personal loans are types of unsecured loans which don’t call for any form of surety (such as your home or other valuable asset). Personal loans are often made use of over a short time period to see to an unforeseen expense like emergency vehicle repairs or an unexpected costly incident.
Personal loans generally have a much longer settlement period than that of payday loans, but will also entail much longer approval periods and will not furnish you with the advantage of virtually instant cash in hand.</a>
