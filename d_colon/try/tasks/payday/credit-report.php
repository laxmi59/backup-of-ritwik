                      <p>Regardless of where you happen to be in your financial life, it can be   beneficial to check your credit report from time to time. If you are unfamiliar   with how your credit report might be used, it is important to understand this   important piece of information. Your credit report will be used by financial   institutions any time you submit an application for credit, a loan or a   mortgage. In addition, your credit report may also be checked at any time in   which you apply for a service or product that might require some type of credit.   The most common example of this would be when you apply for a mobile phone.</p>
                      <p>Any of these companies will want to check your credit rating in order to   understand the type of credit risk they might be taking by providing you with   credit. If your credit score is low, lenders might be reluctant to provide you   with credit. In some instances, you might still be able to obtain credit, but   the interest rate that is offered to you may be higher than it would be if your   credit score is better. </p>
                      <p>Checking your credit report on a regular basis can help you to understand the   condition of your credit report. In addition, if you are turned down for credit,   you can review your credit report to gain an idea of what could be contributing   to a credit refusal. </p>
                      <h3 class="side">&nbsp;</h3>
                      <table width="292" height="34" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                        <tr>
                          <td width="62">&nbsp;</td>
                          <td width="228"><a href="application.php"><img src="images/apply.jpg" width="167" height="41" border="0" /></a></td>

                      </table>
                      
                      </td>

            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><p>In some instances you may find that the credit refusal was not based on a   valid reason. It could well be that there is a mistake on your credit report   such as a typing error or even that inaccurate information was reported. In this   case, you have the right to request that such inaccurate information be removed   from your credit report. This can help to raise your credit score, which can   make it much easier for you to obtain the credit or loans that you need. Higher   credit scores also provide you with advantages, such as lower interest rates and   more flexible repayment terms. </p>
              <p>Keep in mind that when you check your credit report you will need to check it   with all three of the credit reporting bureaus. In the UK, those agencies are   Experian, Equifax and CallCredit. If you discover any problems on your credit   reports, be certain to speak to the relevant agency that reported the   information in order to determine which steps should be taken to have the   information removed. In most instances, the bureau will require that you send in   supporting documentation.</p>
