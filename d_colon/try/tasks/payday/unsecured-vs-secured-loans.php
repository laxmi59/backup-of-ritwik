                      <p>In the uncertain housing and credit situation, you need to understand the   different types of loans and the pros and cons of unsecured vs. secured loans.   If you are under a heavy debt, you have to make a choice regarding which loan is   the best for you. If the current credit market is faring badly, you may have to   be prepared for high interest rates. The market is fluid and you need to compare   secured &amp; unsecured loans for various sectors before you take a decision. </p>
                      <h3 class="side">Unsecured Loans</h3>
                      <p>You need not offer collateral for these loans. These are small amounts of   cash that are needed for minor reasons. They can be returned easily. They also   carry a short loan repayment term. They can be used for funding a small weekend   vacation. They can be used for paying the tuition fee. They can be used for   hiring a nanny. These advances are undoubtedly useful when you need cash quickly   and for a short time. </p>
                      <p>There are many types of unsecured loans. The lender will check your credit   history in most cases. Some of these loans, such as payday loans, do not involve   a credit check. The lender is more or less sure that you will be able to repay   the loan in 15-30 days. In case of other loans without collateral, the interest   is high. All unsecured loans carry high interest rates or fees. Unsecured vs.   secured loans is a better bet if you are sure you can repay in a short time.</p>

            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><h3 class="side">Secured Loans</h3>
              <p>These loans are offered against collateral. The advantages of these are that   they carry lower interest rates. The lender does not run the risk of a bad loan.   He has already secured the collateral. Therefore, the interest is not high. The   collateral is generally in the form of real estate, car, or similar high value   items. </p>
              <h4 class="side">How To Choose</h4>
              <p>Making a judgement in case of unsecured vs. secured loans is not easy. You   need to think clearly about your income, and how much you might be earning a few   years down the line. Most of these loans are long term, especially the secured   ones. So you need to think long term, and be prepared for market volatility.   Remember that variable interest rates are not ideal in case of secured loans.   The rates may sky rocket and you stand to lose your property in case you are   unable to repay the loan. A variable rate is okay if you are opting for   unsecured loans. That is because these loans are generally short term. You can   repay them before interest becomes too high. </p>
              <p>Now that you understand the pros and cons of unsecured vs. secured loans, you   can decide which one to opt for, and how you can make your financial future   better. </p>
