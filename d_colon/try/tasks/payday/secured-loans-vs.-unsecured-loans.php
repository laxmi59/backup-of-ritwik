                    <td valign="top" width="50%"><h2 class="side">Lets look at some of the major similarities, and differences, between   secured and unsecured loans</h2>
                      <p>When you&rsquo;re confronted with financial circumstances in which you need a quick   loan, you might find yourself wondering if a secured loan or an unsecured loan   would be your best choice. It is important to understand the differences between   these two types of loans, and the advantages offered by each loan,when trying to   decide which option would be best. </p>
                      <p>An unsecured loan is also frequently referred to as a personal loan. The   distinguishing characteristic of unsecured loans is that a borrower does not   have to borrow against any type of security in order to get the money. This   means that in the event that you are not able to keep up with the repayments on   your loan, you will not be at risk of losing any of your assets. Typically,   unsecured loans allow you to borrow less money than secured loans because, in   the event you fail to make repayment, the lender might struggle to recoup their   money. </p>
                      <p>In order to obtain a secured loan, a personal asset, like for example your   home will have to be put up as collateral. The lender can legally take   possession of the asset or collateral used to secure the loan should the   borrower fail to repay all the debt. The most common form of collateral for a   loan approval would be your house, but this doesn&rsquo;t always hold true.</p>
                      <p>Secured loans are advantageous over unsecured loans in that they allow the   borrower potential access to more money than may be available through an   unsecured loan. The repayment period for a secured loan may also be for a longer   period of time than with that of an unsecured loan. In some instances, a secured   loan may also provide the borrower with the option of using a variable interest   rate instead of a fixed rate. </p>

                </tbody>
              </table>

            <td width="43" align="center" valign="middle"><img src="images/dot-site.jpg" width="1" height="700" /></td>
            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><p>With a secured loan, the borrower could be at risk of losing their home in   the event they do not repay their loan on time. In only a small number of cases   would a secured loan be the best course of action. In most instances, borrowers   will benefit more from an unsecured personal loan as it has less risk associated   with it with respects to the possibility of losing an asset should repayment of   said loan be delayed or not be possible at all. </p>
              <p>When a consumer wants to typically get a loan that is more than what can be   offered by ways of an unsecured loan then a secured loan will obviously be more   advantageous as it offers a larger amount of cash available to borrow as   compared to an unsecured loan. Perhaps, for this particular situation, it would   be a better option to choose a secured loan. </p>
              <p>Lastly, when shopping around for a secured or an unsecured loan, it is always   important to make sure you check the interest rate that is being offered by the   lender. In addition, you should always find out whether you will be charged a   penalty fee in the event that you likely miss a payment.</p>
