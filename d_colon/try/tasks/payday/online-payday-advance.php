              <p>Many people are confused whether an <a href="application.php" class="sidelink"><strong>Online Payday Advance</strong></a> is a loan, or an advance on your pay. There are several differences  between traditional loans and easy online payday loans. The main  difference is the way interest and penalties are calculated. </p>              
              <p>Learn More About Our <a href="online-payday-advances.php" class="sidelink">Online Payday Advances</a></p>
              <p>The  payday loans work on the premise that your future earnings are part of  your wealth. You will earn the money. It is yours. You should be able  to access your money when you need it, not when your employer&rsquo;s  schedule issues the cheque. </p>
              <p>The payday loan process cannot  be easier. The entire process takes less than 10 minutes. Step one is  filling out the form on the payday loans website. This takes about 5  minutes. There is no need to divulge your private financial  information, endure a waiting period, or wait to see if you are  approved. An Online payday advance is approved in less than 3 minutes.  The money is then transferred to your bank account on the same business  day. </p>
              <p>It is not difficult to get an online payday advance.  The application does not ask what you want to do with the money. That  is your business. The only information you need to supply is your  address, income, and how long you have been with the same employer. The  Online Payday Advance firm will not try to sell any financial  instruments, debt consolidation tools, or long term loans.</p>
              <p>The  only purpose of a payday loan is to help people access their future  wealth on a short-term basis. A reputable company will not affiliate  for other financial organizations and try to sell other products. </p></td>

            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><p>Take a look at the web site&rsquo;s terms. There should be a clause  similar to this, &quot;The Terms are governed by and interpreted in  accordance with the laws of England and Wales and the courts of the  above jurisdiction will have non-exclusive jurisdiction in respect of  any dispute, which may arise.&quot; Do not work with a company that works  outside of the government&rsquo;s regulations. These regulations are designed  to protect you. </p>
              <p>Another word of caution, check the  company&rsquo;s location. Do not work with off shore payday loan companies,  or is not located in the UK. Working with a company off shore can leave  you unprotected against unrealistic and unexpected fees and costs. </p>
              <p>Make  sure the payday loans website you want to work with is regulated, and  reputable. The first thing you need to look for is an SSL  certificate. Click the link and make sure the website is has a real  certificate. This is the only way to ensure that your personal  information is protected. </p>
              <p>Look at the bottom of the  website. There should be logos of government regulatory bodies. These  ensure the company is working within the rules and guidelines. For  example, the payday loan company should never take more than 20% for  the first month. A person should not pay any application,  administration, or legal fees. </p>
              <p>Most important, there is no  credit scoring when applying. The interest paid is not calculated on a  sliding scale, dependant on your credit rating, when you apply for an <strong>online payday advance</strong>.</p>
