No wonder the ability to get an online pay day loan has taken off rather quickly.
At the beginning before pay day loans were available, the only way for consumers to get some quick pay day cash was to physically visit a pay day lending shop where loan approvals could sometimes take as long as 8 hours for just an approval to be granted. You had to take multiple forms of identification and most of the time had to go through a thorough credit check to provide a credit repayment history. With the rapid evolution of the internet these pay day corner shops are virtually almost all extinct with the industry shifting towards an online one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online payday loans are much simpler than having to jump through the hoops of a regular pay day loan lender. These payday loans take up to only 24 hours to be processed and most of the time do not require you to fax any additional documents. - Which used to be a common thing; you would need to fax copies of your driver’s license, bank statements etc. in order to prove who you were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the world coming into a more computer savvy stage online pay day loans have been able to adapt with this modern day trend. They are there for you when you need in extreme financial emergencies or when you just need that little extra help until your next pay day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2008/02/online-pay-day-loans-made-easy.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-8160685193333602385</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2008 07:56:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-02-15T08:01:01.989Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>payday loans</category><title>Bad Credit Payday Loans</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You’re awarded a bad credit history when you consistently fail to repay a loan on time or make continuous defaults while repaying a loan. Whatever the reason might be, if you fail to repay a debt efficiently, it will reflect as a bad mark on your credit history. The problem with a bad credit history is that you won’t be able obtain other financial products at a decent interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payday loans may be used by those who need some emergency cash. Since pay day loans do not require borrowers to provide any collateral as security, consumers can acquire a loan almost immediately. As the name suggests, such loans are provided to help borrowers manage their expenses until their next pay date. This loan is best suited for those people who are running a tight budget, or for those who may need some extra cash to tide over a pressing emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the credit history of a borrower is not usually assessed for a payday loan, all kinds of customers with a bad credit history may apply for a pay day loan. Borrowers can apply for amounts of between £80 and £1000 pounds in some cases. The loans are available for a period of up to 31 days and the borrower is expected to return the money within the said time frame. If the borrower needs to extend the loan, he or she will need to apply for an extension and pay interest for the days that they extended the loan for. The disadvantage with such a loan is that lenders will charge a high interest rate because the loan is provided without the backing of collateral.  But these interest rates are much lower than acquiring an overdraft on your bank account or even the penalty charges on a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payday loans are extremely good to use in an emergency when you just can’t wait that long to acquire some much needed cash. Therefore payday loans should not really be used for anything other than to help you out of an immediate pressing financial fix. While it is a very convenient way to obtain money quickly for your short term needs, consumers who obtain a payday loan without having an idea of how to repay it will most likely be running a financial risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" border="0" height="65" width="480" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2008/02/bad-credit-payday-loans.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-584915376121938353</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2008 20:11:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-02-10T20:21:19.496Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>credit cards</category><title>Prepaid Credit Cards – Convenience at your fingertips!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The newest fad these days are pre-paid credit cards. Why? Simply because they offer everyday consumers with an opportunity to own a zero risk credit card to suit their needs and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’re looking at getting a credit card but are unsure if you will qualify. Perhaps you've had some past credit problems, a poor credit history, or have no guaranteed income with which to apply? Alternatively, maybe you want the security of having a credit card in the case of an unexpected emergency, but without the risk of overspending or being overwhelmed with interest charges?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well now there's an answer to suit your needs! Prepaid credit cards are a great way to get your hands on a credit card without any of the associated risks involved. These cards work on the same principle as a standard credit card but with one major difference, there’s no line of credit. Prepaid credit cards have to first be loaded with cash before you can use them for spending, which eliminates the possibility of getting into a financial fix. Simply top up your card and off you go! Most of the major financial institutions offer these types of cards to customers who might otherwise find it difficult to get a credit card elsewhere. There's no need for a credit check and there's no interest charges either!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However some providers do charge a small fee, sometimes as a once off card issuing charge, to open your account. Prepaid credit cards are accepted everywhere just like ordinary cards which makes them very useful to have indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2008/02/prepaid-credit-cards-convenience-at.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-4989365605037428602</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2008 08:10:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-02-07T08:18:57.732Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>payday loans</category><title>4 Ways to use payday loans responsibly</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has been in a financial fix before and a lifesaver for the majority of consumers is a payday loan. Some upper class and even middle class people tend to see these loans as beneath them, but nothing could be further from the truth. The middle class are often the ones that make the most use of payday loans. When you are faced with some unexpected emergency or expenses, they can really come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" border="0" height="65" width="480" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payday loans have a somewhat bad reputation mainly because a great number of consumers use them irresponsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) The best way to judge whether you need a payday loan is to ask yourself whether you are able to get by without one. Never use a payday loan to purchase something that you can live without, unless it is somehow crucial to how you go about making a living. Payday loans are always best used for emergencies only or as a last financial resort. If you have money you were saving for something else, rather use that instead. You can always start saving again at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Never borrow more money than you know you can easily pay back when it’s due. Most pay day loans are normally due within 30 days. Make sure you know for sure you will have the money to repay the loan with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Understand that you do not get something for nothing. All payday loans do accrued interest. Make sure to factor this in when you consider getting a pay day loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Borrow only what you need at the time. You may be tempted to borrow up to your limit, but consider the fees you will have to repay later.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2008/02/4-ways-to-use-payday-loans-responsibly.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-3554430189101331570</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2008 15:11:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-02T15:12:22.841Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>money management tips</category><title>Tips on Cutting Back on Expenses</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us enjoy the experience of shopping; the feeling of getting new interesting things is an enjoyable activity. That's why we shop and buy new items on a daily basis to fulfil that specific need. Unfortunately, many people and families live way beyond their means causing them to save little or nothing at all. Many spend significant amounts of money that totals more than their income and subsidize their spending habits by using credit cards. Whether you are currently in debt or dabbling with there's no better time than now to consider cutting back on your expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back on expenses is perhaps the best way to avoid debt and it is also a great way to recover from it if you already owe large amounts of cash. You might not like the idea of cutting back on your spending habits, but sometime it's just what you need to do. Here are a few helpful tips on cutting back your expenses and minimize your debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track All Your Monthly Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get into the habit of tracking your spending habits. In order to cut back effectively you need to know what you're spending your money on. Keep track of everything you buy on a daily basis. You'll probably end up being amazed at the end of the month, as to what you're spending all your hard earned cash on. You might also find out that you're spending a lot of money on unnecessary things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop Impulse Shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy buying things on the spur of the moment, with very little thought of the financial consequences, there are a few ways that can minimize this habit. One good strategy is to avoid shopping malls and certain types of stores that promote impulse shopping. While you will still have to shop, one way to keep you on the straight and narrow is to create a shopping list and stick to it. A shopping list will ensure that when you go to the shop to buy a few things, you don't come out spending more than what you intended to spend in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carry a Limited Amount of Cash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you only carry enough money to cover some essentials. Don't carry your entire salary with you at any given time. This will prevent you from spending your entire salary in one go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancel Store Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, store cards offer convenience, but also just a quicker way to get into debt by over spending. It's unnecessary to have several store cards. Having many store cards to your disposal can lead to excessive and out of control spending. Just politely say no the next time a store employee asks if you might be interested in a store card. You might just end up saving yourself a lot of unnecessary debt.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2008/01/tips-on-cutting-back-on-expenses.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-5771380269510739590</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2007 12:26:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:21:06.641Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>student finance</category><title>How you as a Student Can Save Big in Small Ways</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to saving money, we all know that every little bit helps. Even the least budget savvy student can make their monthly income, student loan or their allowance from their parents last longer using a few simple money saving ideas in college:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" border="0" height="65" width="480" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take full advantage of student discounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies who offer student discounts on goods and services don't always advertise these benefits. By showing your valid student ID, you can get discounts on a variety of goods and services like; movie or theatre tickets, software, airfares, food at restaurants etc.  The list goes on and on. Student discounts are particularly common in areas near colleges and universities, so make sure to ask whether a discount to students are offered at the establishments you frequently visit.  Some restaurants even have special student menus offering a variety of cheap meals and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipate your needs and minimize shopping trips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though mini marts and corner shops offer many common household items as well as groceries, their convenience comes at a hefty mark-up. If you wait until you run out of paper towels and toothpaste to purchase more, you will likely end up at the nearest convenience store paying high prices for the items you need.  This habit can diminish your funds fairly quickly. Keep a list of items you are almost out of on your fridge and decide on a day to take a trip to the supermarket to purchase those items on your list.  Not only will you end up paying less for the items on your list, but you will also avoid the trap of making multiple trips to your nearby corner shop and wasting money by picking up extra unnecessary items on each visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat yourself with a trade-off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending your money wisely does not mean you have to give up every all the things you desire or love. Make sacrifices that will allow you to save up for a monthly or bi-monthly splurge. For instance, cut back on the number of times you have take-away or eat out for a designated time period, and use the money you save to treat yourself to something you cannot usually afford.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you spend your savings on some new clothes or a pc game, choose wisely and consider your indulgence a reward for having the self control to save money. You may just discover the inspiration to save money more often!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make every penny count&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start saving some money by keeping a coin jar. Drop all of your loose change into it as often as possible. Using a coin jar allows you to save money without much thought, and regular contributions can add up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By managing to save even a small amount of money can be extremely rewarding, and even more so if you can manage to put some cash away in a savings account on a regular basis. College students are often under the assumption that their money problems will magically disappear once they graduate and get that assured high paying job. This couldn't be further from the truth. Many entry level positions are not glamorous at all, and marginally sufficient to pay the bills at best. Developing good money saving habits in college will however benefit you throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/how-you-as-student-can-save-big-in.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-4790911305206937689</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2007 12:05:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-07-12T11:33:57.815+01:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>budgeting</category><title>Can You Be a Better Spender?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Many people think that if they live on a strict financial "budget":/articles/budgeting.html, they can't spend money on anything fun anymore. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is not just about stashing your money away every month and never enjoying the fruits of your hard labour. We work hard to earn our money so we certainly should enjoy some of it as well. We just have to learn how to do so wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img height="65" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" src="https://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/images/payday_cash_today.gif" width="480" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand it is just stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times haven't we just had to have an item only to finally buy it and it wasn't quite what we thought it would be? One of the key principles to spending wisely is to remember that this stuff is just that, stuff. Nice cars still get old and break down. Electronic goods still become outdated, and even beautiful homes need to be maintained and repaired over time. Nothing we buy will ever bring us true happiness. Owning nice stuff isn't wrong, but you just have to remember where that "stuff" falls in priority to the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't forget the big picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key factor in spending money wisely is to understand what the "opportunity cost" might be. If you are more concerned with what you're driving or what designer labels you're wearing than you are with your retirement planning, you might just end up working much longer than you ever planned on doing. When we make decisions to spend some money, that money is no longer available to be used for other future opportunities. I am not suggesting that you never buy anything nice and just stash all your money away in investments. Instead, I am encouraging you to remember to consider the big picture of what you want to achieve in the long run and see if your spending habits are matching up efficiently to those priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a plan for your money. Most people don't just get in their car and drive off without some kind of idea of where they are going. We usually have a general idea of where we are going and the most direct way to get there. Sure we may stop off here and there to enjoy some attractions or enjoy the scenery along the way, but at the end of the day, our goal is to get wherever it is we are going. The same is true for spending your money. Have a plan. Tell your money what it is going to be doing and then stick to that plan. If there's something you just have to have, then consult the plan and make the necessary adjustments to accommodate that one thing. Remember however that the goal of dealing with your money is to enjoy the process of doing so. Make sure to have fun but avoid unnecessary things that might just cost you more in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/can-you-be-better-spender.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-146335059288360615</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2007 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-13T16:39:13.363Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>payday loans</category><title>Payday Cash Today – Quick Cash when you need it most!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While facing unexpected financial crises, Payday Cash Today could be your rescuer.

Not just your financial goals either, but your "life" goals because, let's face it, most goals involve money.  So sit down and jot down a few things you plan to do when you have some spare cash or those things you know needs to be sorted out as soon as possible.  Does your car need a service soon? How much will this cost? How much would you need to set aside each month to save up for this to happen? Get the idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Your Operating Costs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep on top of your monthly income and expenses by knowing exactly where everything is going. Determine how much your income is and how much you spend on a monthly basis on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses know exactly what’s going on since they have to work to strict budgets and make their future projections according to prior year’s spending patterns. There’s a good chance that you don’t know what it costs to run your household without going broke on a monthly basis. By making out a detailed budget you will start to understand what happens to your money from month to month and that alone will empower you to budget better by cutting out or reducing the costs of unnecessary spending habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Your Net Worth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies will measure progress toward achieving their goals through detailed balance sheets which list all their assets and liabilities. Compile your own balance sheet listing everything that you own and what it’s worth. For example;  list your house (if you own it) checking and savings accounts, investments, vehicles, etc. then subtract everything you owe like personal loans, outstanding credit card balances etc.  Now ask yourself - "If I had to sell everything today, how much cash could I get?"  That will give you an idea of what you are worth when you add up any ready cash and investments you can sell. Review your net worth at least every four months to make sure you're moving towards achieving your personal goals. Without this step, you will only discover the impact of your money decisions probably when it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast the Possible Results of Your Financial Decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a business makes important decisions, they use a future planning process where they look at the possible financial impact of one choice compared to another. You can use the same planning process to make smarter money decisions. For any choice you need to make, pick two options, and then look at what each answer would do to your cash flow and net worth. Bad choices put you farther away from your goals. Good choices get you closer much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give Your Family an Annual Financial Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies report their outcomes to their shareholders in their annual reports. You need to review your list of priorities with your shareholders - your family members, every year. Make them part of the solution. By involving your family members you will achieve your goals faster and easier than trying to achieve them on your own.  Get answers to the goals you set for your family.  Ask yourself this; Have your spending patterns changed? Did you spend less than you earned? Did you save as much as you planned? If you followed these five steps, your household will be a successful company in no time!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/run-your-household-like-corporate.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-3071641437032414011</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2007 13:49:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:11:32.911Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>student finance</category><title>Applying for a Student Credit Card Online</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Those looking to apply for a student credit card online are usually students themselves. The internet has become a popular place for finding suitable financial products to suit everyone’s individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" width="480" height="65" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of young people are given access to a credit card on a yearly basis. Those who opt to apply for a credit card online find the process to be much more straight forward and easier to use than trying to achieve the same results by having to visit a lender or bank personally. Reputable financial sites will strive to make the application process as effortless as possible and might even offer some value-added services as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advantages of such credit cards, as opposed to conventional cards, are that the card is geared specifically with the end-user in mind. Because the card issuer knows that the user is a student he’ll be able to cater for the tastes, needs and special circumstances of that individual. Third party service providers who provide goods and services for people at that stage of their lives and careers will also be available through the card supplier offering a beneficial service to all parties involved. So for those students, who apply for a credit card online, they will be getting more than just an item of credit - they will be getting a whole host of services which are tailored to their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this matter the student can be as specific as he or she wish; when applying for a student credit card online you will be presented with a simple online application form which might take a minute to complete, but you may also be presented with a secondary application form which may ask you to list your specific interests, circumstances and needs as well. Far from seeing this as an intrusion, the applicant can use this as a way of ensuring that only the goods and services deemed of possible use during the life of their account are made available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your needs and circumstances will change as you pass through different phases of your life. The card issuer knows this, and, of course, seeks to cash in on this captive market. When deciding on how and where to apply for a student credit card online, the applicant should make sure to understand his own individual needs first. By determining your immediate and future needs you will get a better understanding as to which type of product to apply for.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/applying-for-student-credit-card-online.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-6540910847033620929</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2007 13:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:12:10.325Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>money management</category><title>How to Create a Simple Spreadsheet to track your monthly expenses - Find Money You Never knew You Had</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You need to keep track of where you spend your money on a monthly basis. This way you will start seeing where your money ends up going month in and out. When seeking financial advice and guidance, this would probably be the first suggestion being made to you by an expert. If you know how to enter numbers into a simple Excel spreadsheet, you can keep track of your spending habits easily. Once you’ve determined where your money is going, you are well on your way to having more money to spend. Yes, you'll find money you didn't know you had. Managing your money effectively doesn't take much time and it will make your life a whole lot easier in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" border="0" height="65" width="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing that's different about this spreadsheet is that you can see all your monthly expenses by category for any given month. All on one page, along with totals by category. In this way it's fairly easy to see exactly where your money is going every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can set up your spreadsheet by month and keep track of your spending habit as they occur over a year. You can even create some folders for each year you keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a spreadsheet that will help you manage your money more easily, start by listing the ways that you pay for services rendered or shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your columns could read for example; house, cars, groceries, restaurant, medical, bank charges, credit card repayments etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to enter you expenses as soon as you can after spending your money on something. This way it will still be very fresh in your mind and you can exactly account for what your money was used for. Make a habit of it to keep all your receipts beside your computer as soon as you get home so you won't forget or delay adding the data to your spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't worry about tracking every pound spent, just try and do the best you can. Remember to clearly name your categories. Avoid setting up a category named “other” or “miscellaneous” because you will never know where this money really went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For credit card, debit card, and check purchases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always enter your total purchase under just one category, such as "grocery," so that you can easily match this number to bank and credit card statements when you look at them to make sure you entered all your expenses in any given month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time you will start seeing your spending habits very clearly. You’ll be able to identify areas where you might be spending too much or you might even discover that you’ve been over charged for a service at any given time. Once you know where your money is going on a monthly basis, start looking for ways to reduce spending on things you don't need. You'll have more money for things you do need and want, and will even be able to save some cash for a rainy day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/how-to-create-simple-spreadsheet-to.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-516797438006275703</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2007 13:45:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:12:50.541Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>debt management</category><title>How can a Debt Consolidation Loan work for you?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Debt consolidation is being used by many as a way to bring their debt worries under control.

This method will usually mean, paying off your debts as quickly as possible and as a result, you end up making large instalment payments over a much shorter period of time. This is definitely a good method for those who can afford to make large payments at a time. For others who unfortunately can't afford to go about reducing their debts in this manner, a debt consolidation loan would be the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A debt consolidation loan consolidates all your debts into one loan, through one lender. Instead of making numerous payments to different creditors on a monthly basis, you simply pay one lender once a month at a repayment amount that works for you. Opting for a repayment plan that allows you to pay just a small amount each month is best for those, who have other more pressing issues to take care of.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/how-can-debt-consolidation-loan-work.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-2955865930418118104</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2007 13:40:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:14:10.599Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>debt management</category><title>Do You need Some Debt Management Advice?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Too many consumers receive debt management advance form the wrong people.

The number of new credit card customers is growing at a rapid pace on a daily basis and give substance to the value that these cards are offering. Not only are more and more customers being created on a daily basis but so also are new companies devising new schemes to offer additional benefits to their client base thereby promoting substantial business growth. You can find new features and benefits being added constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" width="480" height="65" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing the right credit card for your individual needs, it’s important to make sure you choose the card that will offer you the most as a unique individual. Many cards on offer may have tempting offers but with a lot of hidden costs attached. You need to be aware of these unnecessary costs especially if you’re not in the mood to pay them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that you can’t do without a credit card in today's technology driven world, but you can definitely do without the exorbitant costs that might be incurred by reckless spending habits or late repayments.

Chances are that you might overspend purely out of excitement of having your first or new credit card with the thought that repayment will not affect you too badly at month’s end. More often than not, that ends up being a decision you regret at a later stage when money is tight and you end up having to pay high interest charges for your spending spree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So try to be a responsible spender and limit your impulsive, unnecessary spending habits.

It usually happens without warning, and at the wrong times. Your first thought might be to resort to using your high interest credit card to pay for the badly timed, unexpected expense. Why not rather take advantage of an easier, lower costing online solution in the form of a payday loan. Payday loan companies offer quick, easy loan approvals and access to funds within a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" width="480" height="65" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fast, Easy, Convenient Loan Company&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various reasons to why you should opt to use a payday loan. Because of payday loan companies, you no longer have to delay a much needed car or home repair, or even delay paying an urgent utility bill. For almost immediate money, simply complete a loan application online and wait for a reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reply times will vary from lender to lender, but the majority of payday loan lenders will offer quick responses, usually within an hour from application. By making use of an online application will most certainly speed up the loan process even more. This is definitely a convenient way of acquiring some desperately needed funds in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Simple Loan Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When applying for a conventional loan, the task of meeting every requirement put forth by the bank is sometimes a daunting task and difficult to accomplish in a short period of time. Aside from preferring applicants with higher credit ratings, most banks do not approve unsecured loans. Hence, borrowers must have some form of collateral for the loan to be considered and approved. With pay day loan companies, there are no credit checks. Thus, your personal credit rating/score will not influence your loan approval. Moreover, all payday loans are unsecured (no collateral needed) and easily obtainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy Cash Advance Loan Terms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a small fee involved for the convenience of obtaining cash on short notice as with any financial service provided. However this will be a flat fee in the form of a predetermined, set interest rate. As long as you repay the pay day loan by the due date, normally within 30 days, additional charges will not be incurred.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/3-reasons-to-use-payday-loan-company.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-3340558623106524019</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2007 15:21:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:16:07.928Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>payday loans</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>finance</category><title>Understanding the Payday Loan Process</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You have probably already considered a payday loan or quick cash advance to get you through financial rough patch or to pay for an unexpected emergency medical expense or even to repair something on your car. Payday loans are easily available and can be obtained fairly quickly, most times in the same day. Many of us will see a payday cash advance as an instant life saver, but it's better to know what to expect before applying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" width="480" height="65" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, make sure you have read and fully understand the terms and conditions. Don't worry too much if you have bad credit or no credit at all. There are plenty of companies out there that offer fair terms to people who might have suffered some financial difficulty in the past. You will however need to prove some form of income to assure the prospective lender that you will be able to repay the cash advance back once the time arises to do so. Some lenders might also require you to fax some additional documents but some lenders will state to be faxless lenders as well which means that almost everything can be done online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To qualify for just about any loan you would need a steady source of income including payday loans or cash advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't stress too much about the fact that you might be overwhelmed with the amount of fine print involved. Just keep a few key rules of thumb in mind to help you make some good choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some companies might charge a penalty fee if you choose to repay the loan too early. If you are not aware of the penalty, you could end up paying more than you originally anticipated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try finding a company that has no early payoff penalty in place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your credit score is good, then you can most likely find a suitable conventional loan at a lower annual interest rate. However, it usually takes a lot longer to be approved and get your money. If you need some cash fast and you think you'll be able to pay the loan back rather quickly, then a payday loan or cash advance may be right for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying off your loan on time can definitely help build your credit score with lenders. If you take out a payday loan to help you repay another loan or credit card repayment on time, you could avoid a late fee that would have cost you more than you ended up paying in interest on the payday advance. Plus, making a credit card payment late will hurt your credit score even more. Be sure not to borrow more than you can easily pay back by your next pay day. Payday lenders make most of their money off people who can't afford to pay back their loans on time. If you are responsible about it, then a payday loan could really help you out of the financial fix you might be finding yourself in.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/understanding-payday-loan-process.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-4798240782611640318</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2007 13:53:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:16:38.695Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>payday loans</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>money management tips</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>finance</category><title>Five Useful Tips when looking for a suitable Payday Loan</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays finding a payday loan provider is as easy as switching on your computer and typing in Payday Loan into the search box of your favourite search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll be pleasantly surprised by the number of options available to you from within the privacy of your own home and in the comfort of your own armchair. Just the sheer volume of companies looking to fulfil your immediate financial need can be very confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" width="480" height="65" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can only add unnecessary anxiety to an already stressful situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why a few tips on how to make sure you make the right choice the first time when looking to overcome a financial obstacle will prove to be invaluable when put into use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Payday Loans should only be considered as a SHORT TERM solution to your immediate financial crisis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to only borrow what you can afford to pay back on your next payday even if you qualify for a much higher amount. If you borrow too much and are unable to pay it all back come next pay day, it can set you back even further financially resulting in a downward spiralling effect on your finances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) How much will the Payday Loan cost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding out how much the cash advance will cost you should be one of your first considerations when looking for a quick payday loan. Each lending company will have a different interest rate applicable on funds borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before making a final decision on your payday loan of choice, make sure you are comfortable with the interest charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Who am I giving my financial information to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deciding to apply for a payday advance online, make sure your chosen company values your privacy and openly says so. Handing out personal information to companies online can be a daunting experience but with some web savvy guidance you will be sure to keep that which needs to be private, private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also check for a terms of use statement for reassurance that your personal details will not be sold on to any third parties in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) What is the maximum Payday Loan available?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find payday loan sites offering £200, £800, or even £1000 payday loans. Due to the high risk nature of payday loans, do not expect to receive the maximum payday loan amount available on your first cash advance. You will probably not be given the maximum loan amount available until such time as you have proven to the payday loan company your trustworthiness and willingness to repay your advance promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) What are the Payday Loan Repayment Terms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember you should only borrow what you absolutely need and only what you are sure you can afford to pay back on your very next pay day. Normally you'll have 30 days from the date the loan was acquired to be repay. If you are unable to repay your payday advance in full by your next pay day the lender will require you to at least pay the interest accrued to date in full to extend the repayment term. This may vary from company to company so make sure to find this out beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/five-useful-tips-when-looking-for.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6459463436567708266.post-8119420908444290177</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2007 13:13:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-01-15T18:17:08.645Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>payday loans</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>finance</category><title>Need a Quick Payday Loan to Save the Day?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;If you are in need of extra cash until payday, you may want to consider applying for a quick and easy pay day advance online. Payday loans do not require a credit check and are available to those with a healthy or even poor credit record. Many online companies strive for convenience when offering pay day loans to those who are in desperate need of some quick extra cash until payday, but as with all loans and services there is a small cost to this convenience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/payday_cash_today.gif" alt="Click here to Apply for a Payday Cash Advance Now!" width="480" height="65" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use a payday loan for whatever purpose you see fit. You won't ever be asked to explain what you might need the money for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies will offer a same day priority deposit service, ensuring that the funds will be in your designated bank account the very same day you apply. All you need is a valid bank account, be over the age of 18, have some form of income and live in the UK. In some cases you can get a loan of up to £1000 deposited directly into your bank account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payday loans are designed to help you with a short term cash flow problem, for example to pay some unexpected bills or an unexpected emergency which you didn't budget for. They're never really used as a regular source for ongoing lending needs, since the repayment period is very short and interest high. If you need some cash for a bigger expense or event it would be better to consider either an unsecured loan or alternative form of personal loan since your repayment period would be relevantly longer and therefore interest a bit lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay day interest rates will vary from lending company to lending company with some companies offering discounted rates to new or returning customers. By simply supplying the prospective loan company with a few requested details, you could have cash in your account in as little as a few hours. Making use of a payday loan to help out with a short term crisis is understandable, but obtaining one regularly will certainly cost you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies offer you the option to extend your repayment period, should you not be able to repay them come next pay day, by simply repaying the interest due at the time. This of course lengthens the repayment period and inadvertently costs more. The future can unfortunately not be predicted and everyones financial circumstances will be different. Maybe you have a good reason for extending your pay day loan period, but do realise that it will cost you a bit more money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.paydaycashtoday.co.uk/blog/2007/12/need-quick-payday-loan-to-save-day.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Robert)</author></item></channel></rss>
