									<h2>Take Control of your Finances with Savvy Budgeting</h2>

	<p>It seems these days everyone is looking for a way to save money. The best way to track where your money is being spent and saving money is by setting up a budget. Budgeting sounds like a difficult concept to many people, but once it is tackled, many realise how simple and effective it can really be. <br />
The first step in setting up a budget is to get organized and collect all of your income and expense information. Once you have done this you can then begin setting up a budget sheet. Your budget sheet should have categories where you can list each category of income and expense. Such categories might include household expenses, transportation expenses, entertainment, education expenses, grooming, food, medical, charitable giving and miscellaneous expenses. </p>

	<p>When setting up a budget, it can also be helpful to keep a diary for a period of time detailing exactly where you are spending your money. While the budget sheet described above will help with major expenses, it might not capture many of the smaller day to day expenses. Record everything that you spend for at least two weeks to gain an idea of where your money is being spent. This will help you tremendously in tracking your expenses. </p>							</td>
							<td width="50%" valign="top" class="triColumn triColumns2and3" style="border:0">
									<p>It can also be helpful to set up a routine that will assist you in paying your bills on time. If you have experienced problems in the past with late payments, this can be a critical way to make sure your bills are paid on time so you can avoid late payments and penalties and the consequences that might place on your credit profile.</p>

	<p>Try setting up one location where you keep up with all of your bills so that you will not need to look around for them when the appointed time comes to pay your bills. In the same location, make sure you have all of the necessary supplies you might need such as envelopes, pens, a calculator, etc. </p>

	<p>Once you have done this, make sure you spend some time each week analyzing where your money is being spent. You will likely find that you are spending a lot of money on items that you were not aware of it. It may even be possible to cut out some of these expenses so that you can begin saving money. This will give you a cushion in the event an emergency expense should arise as well as keep you from feeling so stressed each month. </p>
