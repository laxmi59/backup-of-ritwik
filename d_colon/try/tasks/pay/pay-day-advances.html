						<h3>Is a Pay day Advance for you? </h3>

	<p>When you think of <a href="apply/payday-advances.html"><strong>pay day advances</strong></a> chances are you will be thinking of being able to get a small loan to take care of any of your personal expenses. What you may not be thinking of is that every <a href="pay-day-advances/quick-pay-day-advances.html">quick pay day advance</a> has some basic requirements that the borrower must meet in order to access the loan. These requirements include steady employment over the last three months, a bank account, and being 18 years old and older. In many cases you are also required to submit documentation proving the three basic requirements.  This seems simple enough but should you get an <a href="pay-day-advances/instant-pay-day-advances.html">instant pay day advance</a> when you are in a financial bind?  The answer to this question lies in what you truly know about <a href="pay-day-advances/same-day-pay-day-advances.html">same day pay day advances</a>.</p>

	<p>One of the things many people are not aware of is that <a href="pay-day-advances/pay-day-advance-loans.html">pay day advance loans</a> can only be had for small amounts of money.  In most cases these quick loans are given for &pound;1000 or less.  Therefore instant pay day advances are not intended for taking care of large bills and other such expenses.</p>

	<p>There is also the matter of the interest that every borrower has to pay on the amount they are advanced.  This interest is called the Annual Percentage Rate (<span class="caps">APR</span>) and varies from lender to lender but is usually close to 1200% and can even be higher. This rate charged by the lender is considered to be normal for these kinds of loans as they are usually quick <ins>pay day advances</ins> given without any collateral.  In the UK, lenders are required to advertise the <span class="caps">APR</span> prominently on their websites and in any advertised media.</p>

	<p>Borrowers will have the option to roll over same day pay day advance should they not be able to pay up the advance when it becomes due.  This however will cost the borrower an additional fee at the same rates as is stated in the initial agreement.  This is a great feature of types of loans and sometimes the borrower might meet with unexpected financial emergencies and, in turn, needs more time to repay their advance.  Roll over options can prove to be very troublesome for a borrower especially if they keep rolling over the pay day advance and not repaying. This must be managed carefully or the borrower will find themselves in greater debt.  Some pay day advance providers restrict the number of times the advance can be rolled over and have put in placed policies that require some part of the capital amount to be paid before the advance is rolled over more than twice.  </p>

	<p>Many lenders provide advances within a day or two and do not do any credit checks. With a <a href="pay-day-advances/no-faxing-pay-day-advances.html">no faxing pay day advance</a> there&#8217;s also no need to send in any additional paperwork for the no faxing pay day advance to be approved.  They also do not assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay.  It is important that borrowers understand that pay day advances are not for everyone and they should consider carefully the requirements necessary to get the advance and what they will have to contend with if they make use of a <a href="apply/pay-day-advances.html"><strong>pay day advance</strong></a>.  It is also important that they also do not abuse these kinds of loans.</p>				</div>
