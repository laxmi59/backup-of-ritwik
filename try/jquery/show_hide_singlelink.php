<p>When you join a casino affiliate program you are supplied banners, text links and live games that allow your visitors to go to a casino and sign up as a new player. Each visitor is carefully tracked through cgi scripts and cookies and labeled as a player you referred. You then earn a percentage of their net game play.</p><br />
<p>Each program  is different, but you generally earn 20 - 50% of the profits off that player for life! The average profit on a single player is $64.00 per month, so the revenue Casino Affiliate Programs generate can be staggering. Since you earn money on each player for life you are building a monthly income that can quickly add up to thousands of dollars each month per program.</p><br />

<p>At Casino Affiliate Programs we review and rate the hundreds of partner programs available. Not all of them are equal and not every operator is reputable, so we make every attempt to weed out the bad ones and present you with the best opportunities for profit. Please visit our site often and keep up to date on the latest Casino Affiliate Programs.</p>
