									<h2>Lets look at some of the major similarities, and differences, between secured and unsecured loans</h2>

	<p>When you&#8217;re confronted with financial circumstances in which you need a quick loan, you might find yourself wondering if a secured loan or an unsecured loan would be your best choice.  It is important to understand the differences between these two types of loans, and the advantages offered by each loan,when trying to decide which option would be best. </p>

	<p>An unsecured loan is also frequently referred to as a personal loan. The distinguishing characteristic of unsecured loans is that a borrower does not have to borrow against any type of security in order to get the money. This means that in the event that you are not able to keep up with the repayments on your loan, you will not be at risk of losing any of your assets. Typically, unsecured loans allow you to borrow less money than secured loans because, in the event you fail to make repayment, the lender might struggle to recoup their money. </p>

	<p>In order to obtain a secured loan, a personal asset, like for example your home will have to be put up as collateral. The lender can legally take possession of the asset or collateral used to secure the loan should the borrower fail to repay all the debt. The most common form of collateral for a loan approval would be your house, but this doesn&#8217;t always hold true.</p>

	<p>Secured loans are advantageous over unsecured loans in that they allow the borrower potential access to more money than may be available through an unsecured loan. The repayment period for a secured loan may also be for a longer period of time than with that of an unsecured loan. In some instances, a secured loan may also provide the borrower with the option of using a variable interest rate instead of a fixed rate. </p>							</td>
							<td width="50%" valign="top" class="triColumn triColumns2and3" style="border:0">
									<p>With a secured loan, the borrower could be at risk of losing their home in the event they do not repay their loan on time. In only a small number of cases would a secured loan be the best course of action. In most instances, borrowers will benefit more from an unsecured personal loan as it has less risk associated with it with respects to the possibility of losing an asset should repayment of said loan be delayed or not be possible at all. </p>

	<p>When a consumer wants to typically get a loan that is more than what can be offered by ways of an unsecured loan then a secured loan will obviously be more advantageous as it offers a larger amount of cash available to borrow as compared to an unsecured loan. Perhaps, for this particular situation, it would be a better option to choose a secured loan. </p>

	<p>Lastly, when shopping around for a secured or an unsecured loan, it is always important to make sure you check the interest rate that is being offered by the lender. In addition, you should always find out whether you will be charged a penalty fee in the event that you likely miss a payment.</p>
