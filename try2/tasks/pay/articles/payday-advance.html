									<h2>How Fast Can You Get Money from a Payday Advance?</h2>

	<p>Online <a href="../apply/payday-advances.html"><strong>payday advance</strong></a> sites provide the fastest way to get a payday advance until pay day.  If you are in need of some extra money quickly, you should consider these types of short term loans as they are approved fast and with minimal requiremets.</p>

	<p>More about <a href="../payday-advances.html">Payday Advances</a></p>

	<p>Some people are under the conception that they can walk into a payday lender location and get cash within just a few minutes.  This isn&#8217;t always the case.  It usually depends on your situation and if you are a returning customer or not.  The speed of payday advances also depends on your bank, the time of day, and the day of the week.</p>

	<p>Your bank can have everything to do with when you receive your payday advance as their processing schedule will determine as to when you will be receiving the proceeds of your cash loan.  If you apply and are approved on the weekend or at night then you may not receive the money on either one of those days and only on the following business day.  This is because payday advances are usually deposited directly into your bank account and the cash no handed over to you. Nor does the payday lender mail you a check.</p>							</td>

									<p>If you are a new customer applying for a loan then it may take even longer should you attempt to apply for your advance the conventional way by visiting a finance store.  </p>

	<p>Depending on how far away your next pay day is the amount of time you would have to repay your loan in would be shorter, but don&#8217;t fret as the lender will in most cases allow you to extend your repayment term should you need to.  The fastest way of getting an advance until your next pay check arrives would be by applying for a pay day loan online at one of the various websites that offer this kind of service.  The great news is that by applying online, you cut down on physical leg work as many online websites these days offer you the opportunity to apply at multiple lenders at the same time by simply filling in one simple application form. Once you have been making use of an online service and become a returning customer, the waiting time for receiving your funds will be less.</p>

	<p>Returning customers usually don&#8217;t have to wait a long time for their money to be deposited into their accounts either as their information is already in the system.  In addition, a returning customer has established a reputation for being good for the money.  The lender knows they will receive their money back and therefore will also consider increasing the amount available for borrowing.</p>

	<p>When you apply for <strong>payday advances</strong> the first time you don&#8217;t always get the cash amount you applied for in full.  This is because you have yet to establish a lending profile with the lender.  Once that has taken place the lender will be more willing to increase the amount of cash available to you.</p>
