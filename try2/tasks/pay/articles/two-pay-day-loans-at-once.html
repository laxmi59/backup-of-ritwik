									<h2>Why You Can&#8217;t Have More than One Pay day Loan at Once</h2>

	<p>There are many reasons why you cannot have two <a href="../apply/pay-day-loans.html"><strong>pay day loans</strong></a> at once.  The reasons include security for you and for the <a href="../pay-day-loans.html">pay day loan</a> lenders who give you the money you require when you require it.</p>

	<p>Read more about <a href="../pay-day-loans/same-day-pay-day-loans.html">Pay day Loans</a></p>

	<p>When you consider pay day loans you need to be sure of the amount of money you need to borrow.  You don&#8217;t want to get into a situation where you didn&#8217;t borrow enough and you need more or you borrow too much and you struggle to pay it back.  This is because you will not be able to get more than one pay day cash loan at the same time.  Most of the lenders work through the same system and they will be able to know if you already have an existing pay day loan out or not.  You shouldn&#8217;t even try because this will only make you look bad if you try to deceive lenders about the fact that you already have already gotten one and try to apply somewhere else for another one.</p>

	<p>One of the reasons you cannot have more than one pay day loan at the same time is because it is too difficult for people to pay the money back.  You might have it figured out perfectly and think that you can pay back two pay day cash loans at once with the funds from your next pay check.  However, past experience shows that people simply really struggle or just cannot pay back two advances from the same pay check.</p>							</td>
							<td width="50%" valign="top" class="triColumn triColumns2and3" style="border:0">
									<p>A payday lender also wants to be sure that they are going to get the money back.  They need to know for sure that you are good for the advance and that they will.  Not many people can afford to spend their entire check on two pay day loans along with their respective fees.  You are not an exception.  Everyone must adhere to the same rules.  It is the best arrangement for you and for the pay day lender.  Even if you shop around, you will not find a lender who will give you two pay day loans at once.</p>

	<p>No one is allowed to acquire two pay day loans at the same time.  These rules are for your protection financially but more so for the lender giving you the loan. When applying for <strong>pay day loans</strong> remember that less is always better when it comes to having to pay back your advance.  However, be sure you ask for enough money to get you through until your next payday arrives.</p>
