This method will usually mean, paying off your debts as quickly as possible and as a result, you end up making large instalment payments over a much shorter period of time. This is definitely a good method for those who can afford to make large payments at a time. For others who unfortunately can't afford to go about reducing their debts in this manner, a debt consolidation loan would be the alternative.</p><p>A debt consolidation loan consolidates all your debts into one loan, through one lender. Instead of making numerous payments to different creditors on a monthly basis, you simply pay one lender once a month at a repayment amount that works for you. Opting for a repayment plan that allows you to pay just a small amount each month is best for those, who have other more pressing issues to take care of.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="debt%20management.html">debt management</a></p>
