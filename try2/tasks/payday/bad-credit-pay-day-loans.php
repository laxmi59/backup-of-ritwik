              <p><a href="application.php" class="sidelink"><strong>Bad credit pay day   loans</strong></a> are custom made for people who are struggling financially. <a href="payday-loans.php" class="sidelink">Payday loans</a> do not require a credit check, or   faxing private financial documents to prove income. Anyone can qualify for bad   credit payday loans. Approval averages 90%, with no questions asked. You can use   the money for anything you want. The money does not need to go to renovations,   paying bills, or emergencies.</p>
              <p>Learn More About <a href="pay-day-loans.php" class="sidelink">Bad Credit Pay Day   Loans</a></p>
              <p>The loan is designed to fulfill short-term needs and cover emergencies. It is   impossible to predict when an illness will force you into the role of caregiver,   or the weather will increase utility bills. Many people end up in financial   difficulty through no fault of their own. An emergency can hit any time. This is   the best time to apply for a payday loan.</p>
              <p>A payday loan can help you pay for emergencies without engaging in a long   term credit card debt, or small loan. A bad credit payday loan does appear to   have a higher interest rate, but when compared to other debt consolidation and   emergency loans, the payday loan is a cost effective alternative.</p>
              <p>The payday loan offers an advance against your future earnings. The loan is   offered on a 30 day term. This can be extended easily, if needed. After a few   weeks the loan is repaid and you can continue without the stress of carrying   debt for months.</p>

            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><p>Some bad credit pay day loans offer a lower rate for returning customers. Bad   credit should not stop employed adults from applying for a payday loan to help   you overcome a higher than normal expense.</p>
              <p>Poor credit or a bad credit history will not be held against any payday loan   applicant. In fact, a no-fax company does not require you to send private   documents to verify your employment or financial status. All you need to do is   fill out the short form. The company will approve the loan within minutes.</p>
              <p>The loan is issued based on your employment and expected income, not your   credit rating, or debt load. If you are employed, over 18 years old, and make   more than &pound;700 then there is no reason you cannot have a payday loan deposited   into your account within a few hours.</p>
              <p>The payday loan is perfect for people who have been turned down for credit   cards. It gives them the opportunity to use their cash to pay bills, even if   they have not been paid. In the long term, it is possible that using a payday   loan can save money over credit cards that charge as much as 30% interest, and   can charge extra fees if you &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; use the card for 90 days. The payday loan   puts the control in your hands. Payday loans are for people with unsecured   credit, high risk credit, and who have not been working long enough to have   built a credit report.</p>
              <p><strong>Bad credit pay day loans</strong> are the perfect solution to anyone   facing missed bill payments, putting debt on high interest credit cards, or   being forced to consolidate several small loans into one large, long term loan.</p></td>
