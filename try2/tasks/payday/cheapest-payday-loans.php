              <p>The <strong>cheapest payday loans</strong> are not always the best deals.   There are some payday loan companies that offer only 10%, but they have a few   very unfavorable clauses in the agreement. The purpose of a <a href="payday-loans.php" class="sidelink">payday loan</a> is to eliminate the stress you endure   when bills pile up. Shop around for a deal that&rsquo;s favourable overall. Applying   for one of the ultra cheap payday loans eliminates that benefit.</p>
              <p>Most households need a quick personal loan from time to time Credit card   companies are becoming tight, making it difficult to pay bills on time and   protect your credit rating. Banks are tightening up their overdrafts, leaving   people with an ever increasing inflation rate, and no way to access the money   you&rsquo;ve already worked for.</p>
              <p>Find Out About the <a href="application.php" class="sidelink"><strong>Cheapest Pay   Day Loans</strong></a></p>
              <p>There is no reason to pawn family heirlooms or your precious possessions to   pay an unexpected bill, especially when you&rsquo;ll have the cash needed within a few   weeks. The solution is a payday loan. It is unlikely that you&rsquo;ll find favorable   terms in the cheapest payday loans. However, the average rate is 20%, not a high   cost when your valuables, credit rating, and peace of mind are at stake.</p>
              <p>There are some companies that offer low fee pay day loans for first time   customers. The &lsquo;almost free&rsquo; companies can offer a couple thousand pounds to   qualified borrowers. The client borrows the money before they realize they&rsquo;ve   applied for a short-term personal loan, not a true payday loan.</p></td>
            <td width="43" align="center" valign="middle"><img src="images/dot-site.jpg" width="1" height="600" /></td>
            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><p>Those companies that offer the cheapest payday loans often lend less than   300. This may help pay a utility bill, but it is rarely enough to repair a   vehicle or replace a broken appliance. It is certainly not enough to cover   medical expenses or help care for an ill family member.</p>
              <p>All payday loans are fairly cheap. The average fee is 20%. Paying &pound;200 on   &pound;1000 for one month is less than the cost of a retailer&rsquo;s small loan that has   been calculated at 10 &ndash; 20% over a year or two. Remember, the purpose of a   payday loan is to help with short term financial difficulties.</p>
              <p>The biggest benefit of the payday loan is that it lets the borrower repay the   loan within 30 days, and eliminate the debt load they carry. This helps them   establish their credit and maintain a solid budget. They goal is to help   households protect themselves against financial dilemmas without building an   unbearable debt load.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows the feeling when the gap between the &lsquo;end of the month&rsquo; seems   endless. Each day is dreaded. Each expense appears to be insurmountable. A   payday loan helps families bridge the gap.</p>
              <p>Just borrow smart, not fast. The cheapest payday loans are not always in the   borrower&rsquo;s best interest. It may be a good idea to review the lender well. It is   a better deal to pay 20% for an easy application process that does not demand   information about your private financial conditions. The approval process is   often completed within minutes, and the money is in your bank account within   hours. The best deal for your household may not always be the <strong>cheapest   payday loans</strong>.</p>
