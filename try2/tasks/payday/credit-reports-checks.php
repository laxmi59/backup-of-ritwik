                      <p>Conducting credit reports/checks regularly helps you avoid being refused a   loan. Experian and Equifax are the main agencies that compile credit reports. </p>
                      <h3 class="side">What Information Do These Reports Offer?</h3>
                      <p>Credit reports/checks offer information regarding your credit history. You   can check county court judgment records, bankruptcy, and credit defaults against   your name. You can also find out which loan companies have requested for   information on your credit score. </p>
                      <h3 class="side">View Records Online</h3>
                      <p>An online credit report helps you view your credit history online. All the   information is made available through third parties in collaboration with the   credit rating agencies. You can log in using a user name and password, and then   scan the credit report. It is safe. You do not have to worry about anyone   gaining access to your personal information. If you are pressed for time, then   getting information online is recommended. It also helps you get an idea of the   ratings that you have got from both the agencies. </p>
                      <h3 class="side">Fees</h3>
                      <p>You can take a look at your credit report as many times as you want in return   for subscription with an online service provider. Free credit reports are the   best way to judge your chances of getting a loan. If you have to apply to more   than one agency for a loan at different times, it is not worth paying repeatedly   for checking the credit scores.</p>

              <p>Credit reports/checks are affected by repayment history, current debts,   previous loan terms, and types of loans. If your repayment history was good and   you did not default on payment, you get a high credit score. A high score   increases your chances of getting loans on easier terms and lower interest   rates. </p>
              <p>Apart from good repayment records, your score becomes high if:</p>
              <ul style="list-style:none">
                <li><img src="images/aro.jpg" width="12" height="11" />&nbsp;You are a fulltime employee with a registered company </li>
                <li><img src="images/aro.jpg" width="12" height="11" />&nbsp;You own a house </li>
                <li><img src="images/aro.jpg" width="12" height="11" />&nbsp;You have been residing in your current home for a few years </li>
                <li><img src="images/aro.jpg" width="12" height="11" />&nbsp;You are a registered voter </li>
              
                <li><img src="images/aro.jpg" width="12" height="11" />&nbsp;You do not borrow too often </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Note that the credit rating agency does not assign a score. It simply has a   record of your credit history. The credit score is assigned by the loan company   based on your credit record and information that you provide through the   application forms. This is important as many borrowers feel disheartened once   they see their credit record. However, the decision to lend to you is based on   certain other factors apart from your credit history. If you have access to   credit reports/checks, you can understand your credit record and take steps to   increase your chances of getting a loan. </p>
              <p>Viewing your credit reports/checks before applying for a loan is important,   as you can take informed decisions regarding the type of loan, a reasonable   interest rate, and the loan company to deal with. </p>
