              <p>There are many reasons why you cannot have two <a href="application.php" class="sidelink"><strong>pay day loans</strong></a> at once. The   reasons include security for you and for the <a href="pay-day-loans.php" class="sidelink">pay   day loan</a> lenders who give you the money you require when you require it.</p>
              <p>Read more about <a href="same-day-pay-day-loans.php" class="sidelink">Pay day   Loans</a></p>
              <p>When you consider pay day loans you need to be sure of the amount of money   you need to borrow. You don&rsquo;t want to get into a situation where you didn&rsquo;t   borrow enough and you need more or you borrow too much and you struggle to pay   it back. This is because you will not be able to get more than one pay day cash   loan at the same time. Most of the lenders work through the same system and they   will be able to know if you already have an existing pay day loan out or not.   You shouldn&rsquo;t even try because this will only make you look bad if you try to   deceive lenders about the fact that you already have already gotten one and try   to apply somewhere else for another one.</p>
              <p>One of the reasons you cannot have more than one pay day loan at the same   time is because it is too difficult for people to pay the money back. You might   have it figured out perfectly and think that you can pay back two pay day cash   loans at once with the funds from your next pay check. However, past experience   shows that people simply really struggle or just cannot pay back two advances   from the same pay check.</p>

            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><p>A payday lender also wants to be sure that they are going to get the money   back. They need to know for sure that you are good for the advance and that they   will. Not many people can afford to spend their entire check on two pay day   loans along with their respective fees. You are not an exception. Everyone must   adhere to the same rules. It is the best arrangement for you and for the pay day   lender. Even if you shop around, you will not find a lender who will give you   two pay day loans at once.</p>
              <p>No one is allowed to acquire two pay day loans at the same time. These rules   are for your protection financially but more so for the lender giving you the   loan. When applying for <strong>pay day loans</strong> remember that less is   always better when it comes to having to pay back your advance. However, be sure   you ask for enough money to get you through until your next payday arrives.</p>
