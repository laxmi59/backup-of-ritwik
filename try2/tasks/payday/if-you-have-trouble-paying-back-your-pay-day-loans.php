              <p>It is common for people to have difficulty paying back their <a href="application.php" class="sidelink"><strong>instant pay day loans</strong></a>. It   is also common for people to apply for instant pay day loans with the full   intentions of paying back their loans who ends up finding themselves not able to   do so. There are options available if you cannot afford to pay back your <a href="pay-day-loans.php" class="sidelink">pay day loan</a> all at once.</p>
              <p>More about <a href="instant-pay-day-loans.php" class="sidelink">Instant Pay   day Loans</a></p>
              <p>Some people select the option to pay back their instant pay day loans all at   once out of their next pay check and then they realize they were not really in a   position to afford it later. If this happens to you then you do have options.   You should contact the lender from which you received your instant pay day loan   from right away.</p>
              <p>Deferment or repayment extension is an option through most lenders. If you   realise you really cannot afford to pay back your advance straight away, once   you have received your pay cheque then you should ask for an extension.   Deferment on instant pay day loans will however incur some additional charges.   Should you take out more than two deferments on instant pay day loans then you   might be required to pay monthly charges until the loan is paid off   entirely.</p>
              <p>The purpose of these types of short term advances are to provide financial   assistance to people who are having financial difficulties. They are not a form   of long term financial solution and should never be considered as such. </p>

              <p>You should never borrow money off of your pay check if you really cannot   afford to pay the money back. It is important to know for sure if will be able   to do so. If you have difficulty or realise that you cannot pay the loan back   then you must let lender know right away so they can do what they can to help   you out. You don&rsquo;t want to be in an even worse off financial situation. If you   don&rsquo;t pay back your loan you might never qualify for another pay day loan again   as the lender might be under the impression that you&rsquo;re unfortunately not good   for the loan.</p>
              <p>If you need to put off paying back your <strong>instant pay day loan</strong> then you can get a deferment or extension on your repayment term. When you get a   deferment it will increase the amount of money you are required to pay back   through the addition of additional interest charges.</p>
