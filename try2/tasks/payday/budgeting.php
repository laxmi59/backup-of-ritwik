                      <p>It seems these days everyone is looking for a way to save money. The best way   to track where your money is being spent and saving money is by setting up a   budget. Budgeting sounds like a difficult concept to many people, but once it is   tackled, many realise how simple and effective it can really be. <br />
                        The first   step in setting up a budget is to get organized and collect all of your income   and expense information. Once you have done this you can then begin setting up a   budget sheet. Your budget sheet should have categories where you can list each   category of income and expense. Such categories might include household   expenses, transportation expenses, entertainment, education expenses, grooming,   food, medical, charitable giving and miscellaneous expenses. </p>
                      <p>When setting up a budget, it can also be helpful to keep a diary for a period   of time detailing exactly where you are spending your money. While the budget   sheet described above will help with major expenses, it might not capture many   of the smaller day to day expenses. Record everything that you spend for at   least two weeks to gain an idea of where your money is being spent. This will   help you tremendously in tracking your expenses.</p>

            <td width="295" align="left" valign="top"><p>It can also be helpful to set up a routine that will assist you in paying   your bills on time. If you have experienced problems in the past with late   payments, this can be a critical way to make sure your bills are paid on time so   you can avoid late payments and penalties and the consequences that might place   on your credit profile.</p>
              <p>Try setting up one location where you keep up with all of your bills so that   you will not need to look around for them when the appointed time comes to pay   your bills. In the same location, make sure you have all of the necessary   supplies you might need such as envelopes, pens, a calculator, etc. </p>
              <p>Once you have done this, make sure you spend some time each week analyzing   where your money is being spent. You will likely find that you are spending a   lot of money on items that you were not aware of it. It may even be possible to   cut out some of these expenses so that you can begin saving money. This will   give you a cushion in the event an emergency expense should arise as well as   keep you from feeling so stressed each month. </p>
